Get the release for your relevant nodejs build that was used to make the
bytecode from https://github.com/suleram/View8/releases and put it in the Bin folder.

In my case, the bytecode was compiled using Nodejs 18 so I 
got the release file 10.2.154.26.exe at https://github.com/suleram/View8/releases/download/v1.0/10.2.154.26.exe .

I had to rename the file to 10.2.154.4.exe because thats the version the View8 code expected.

Now install the dependency:
pip install parse

Now run the decompilation command:
python .\view8.py -input_file .\index.js -output_file ind.js


PS:
The app I was decompiling was originally created using @vercel/pkg. I had to 
first generate the bytecode using a repo called pkg-unpacker (https://github.com/LockBlock-dev/pkg-unpacker).
This gave me the index.js file which I first inspected using the hex editor and decompiled using this View8 repo.
